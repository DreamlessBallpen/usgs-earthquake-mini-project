# For this specific case: Taking JSON data and extracting key-value pairs to create a structured DataFrame.

# 4. Do Something Insightful
# Examples:
# Plot a histogram of earthquake magnitudes									[DONE]
# Plot top 10 locations with the most quakes
# (Optional) Convert UNIX timestamps to readable time
# (Optional) Map quakes by coordinates using seaborn.scatterplot
# 5. Write Observations
# In comments or markdown, write 2‚Äì3 simple insights
# "Most quakes are below magnitude 3."
# "Region X had 12 small quakes this week."
# üìÅ Deliverables
# A Jupyter notebook or .py file with your code
# Screenshots or saved PNGs of your plots (if any)

# 05/18/2025 - TODO: working on parsing first before using json_normalize. [DONE]
# 5/20/2025 - TODO: Working on the next steps.  - Normalize the json using json_normalize. [DONE]
# 5/26/2025 - Currently working on the next set of tasks -- creating visualizations and insights.
# 6/7/2025 - Still working on the visualizations.
# 6/7/2025 - Single focus: [TODO] Figure out code to create histograms. Currently being figured out in earthquake_data_histogram.py [DONE]
